## Introduction to Django
- It is free and open-source web framework for building web apps with python.
- It helps build web apps with less code and less time.
- It has most feature inbuilt
    - It has admin interface
    - It has Object-relational mapper
    - It has authetication
    - It has caching

## Fundamentals of web development
- Websites have two parts: frontend and backend
- Frontend is loaded on web browser on client machine
- Backend is loaded on webserver and reponsible for business logic
- The address needed to visit the web site is URL
- It locates a resource on the internet which can be a web page, image, video or pdf
- The browser sends a request to web server when user enters a URL in browser address bar.
- This communication is defined by HTTP
- For each page access while navigation by user, the browser sends an http request and in turn recieves a response page back
- The requested page is generated by web server and sent to user as HTML document
- Other option for web server is to send the data requested and client generates HTML.
- This is the best practice as it allows the web browser to serve more users.
- Client side web page generating framework are:
    - React
    - Angular
    - Vue
- Server side tools for building backend
    - Django
    - ASP.NET CORE
    - EXPRESS
- When we assign the client side is resonsible for generating web page, the backend server basically acts as gateway to data.
- The backend provides the endpoints to retrived various types of data by the user. The API

## Setting up development environment
- Update python to latest version
- pip3 install pipenv
- pipenv install Django
- pipenv shell will launch subshell in virtual environment
- django-admin is a tool that comes with django and it creates a django project `django-admin startproject eCommerceApp .` in the current working directory.
- django-admin startproject will start the project straightaway so, we have to run `python manage.py runserver PORT_NUMBER, will attach PORT_NUMBER 8000 if not provided.

## Your First Django project
- Every django project is collection of certain apps that provide respective functionalities
- can check `settings.py` module
- `INSTALLED_APPS` list provides definition of various apps possible with django, for example - `django.contrib.admin` that controls admin, `django.contrib.auth` that covers authentication, `django.contrib.messages` is used for displaying one time messages to the user, `django.contrib.staticfiles` are used to host static web pages, images etc. in there.
- we can create our own app too, open a new terminal window and start the same pipenv environment ie. Django-code and write code `python3 manage.py startapp <app-name>`
- migration folder here is used to generate database table
- admin module defines how the admin module for this app will look like.
- apps module configures this app.
- model module is used to define model classes for the app to pull out data from database and present to the app.
- tests module contains the unittest for the app.
- view module is the request handler
- we have to register this app by add the name to the INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

- view module is used in data exchange as http request-response.
- in views module you define the view function, the view function takes a request, optionally modify it and returns a response as a request handler
- simple response can be done with `return HttpResponse('string')` in this function.
- we can have a separate module `urls.py` for mapping urls to view functions.
- in the urls.py for playground we add urlconfiguration for every app
- in the urls.py for eCommerceApp we add the urlconfiguration for playground and other apps.
- template.py is used to hold views/template to return html content for the client, so in templates folder we create html file.
- Now for html file will need to respond with html markup to the client for which the normal HttpResponse need to be replaced with render function as return `render(request, <file.html>)`
- we can send additional arguments in the form of a dictionary as render function's third argument and it will be accessible with the key name in html file in templates mentioned in render function.
- *we should use django to build APIs that return data most of the time thus, templates are not used mostly unless it is the special cases*.
- We can debug django apps with vscode debugger or we can install django-debugger-toolbar which can be installed with pipenv in the python environment.
- To setup django-debug-toolbar after install we have to
    - add `debug_toolbar` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
    - add 'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware' to `MIDDLEWARE`
    - add `INTERNAL_IPS = ['127.0.0.1',]` to settings.py
